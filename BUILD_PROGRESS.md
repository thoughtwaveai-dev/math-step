## Completed Milestones

### Milestone 25 — In-App Feedback System (2026-04-17)

**Phase 1 — Database**
- `feedback` table created manually in Supabase SQL editor: `id`, `parent_id` (FK → auth.users), `student_id` (nullable FK → students, on delete set null), `category`, `message`, `created_at`.
- RLS enabled: parents can only insert/select their own rows (`parent_id = auth.uid()`).

**Phase 2 — Feedback form**
- `src/app/feedback/page.tsx` — protected server page. Auth guard, fetches parent's students and recent feedback. Shows success banner when `?sent=1`. Lists recent submissions below the form.
- `src/app/feedback/FeedbackForm.tsx` — client component with `useActionState`. Fields: category (select), optional student selector, message (textarea). Inline error display.

**Phase 3 — Replace mailto links**
- All "Send feedback" footer links updated from `mailto:feedback@mathstep.app` → `/feedback` in: landing page, dashboard, privacy, terms, disclaimer.
- Inline email address references in legal page body text left as-is (intentional contact address).

**Phase 4 — Feedback list**
- Recent submissions shown on `/feedback` page below form: category badge (color-coded), linked student name if applicable, date, message preview (line-clamp-3). Up to 20 most recent entries.

**Phase 5 — Server action**
- `src/app/actions/feedback.ts` — `submitFeedback` server action: validates category against allowlist, verifies student ownership if provided, inserts to `feedback` table, redirects to `/feedback?sent=1`.

No new dependencies. No DB schema changes beyond the new `feedback` table.

### Milestone 24 — Beta Readiness Polish (2026-04-17)

**Phase 1 — Landing page**
- `src/app/page.tsx` — full rewrite. Sections: hero with logo/headline/CTAs, "How it works" 3-step cards, "Why MathStep?" 4-benefit grid, tablet/mobile note, footer with legal links + feedback mailto.
- CTAs: "Get started free" → `/signup`, "Log in" → `/login`.
- Copy clearly targets parents; positions MathStep as mastery-based daily practice, not repetitive busywork.

**Phase 2 — Legal pages**
- `src/app/privacy/page.tsx` — what we collect, children's privacy, data deletion, Supabase storage disclosure.
- `src/app/terms/page.tsx` — who can use it, beta limitations, acceptable use, no guarantees.
- `src/app/disclaimer/page.tsx` — educational tool only, no academic outcome guarantees, parental supervision, beta limitations.
- All pages: plain English, consistent brand header/footer, links to each other.

**Phase 3 — Feedback CTA**
- Feedback mailto link (`feedback@mathstep.app`) added to landing page footer and dashboard footer.
- Also linked from all legal pages.
- **Placeholder:** update `feedback@mathstep.app` to your real email before sharing publicly.

**Phase 4 — Onboarding clarity**
- `src/app/onboarding/page.tsx` — improved subtitle ("first name or nickname — that's all we need").
- For first-time parents: 3 short bullet points explaining mastery progression, multi-student support, and tablet/mobile compatibility.
- Returning parents (adding a student) see clean form without the intro bullets.

No DB schema changes. No new dependencies.

### Suite 24 — Beta Readiness Polish (2026-04-17)
| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Landing page renders: hero, how it works, why mathstep, footer with legal links | PASS |
| "Get started free" CTA links to /signup | PASS |
| "Log in" CTA links to /login | PASS |

| No console errors on any page | PASS |
| TypeScript: build clean, no type errors | PASS |

### Milestone 23 — Multi-Student Support (2026-04-17)

**Selection mechanism:** URL query param `?student=<uuid>`. Works natively with Next.js 16 server components. Falls back to first student (by `created_at asc`) when param is absent or doesn't match any owned student. No DB schema changes required.

**Phase 1 — Student selection model**
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` — accepts `searchParams: Promise<{ student?: string }>`, fetches all students (no `.limit(1)`), resolves selected student from param or defaults to first. Student switcher (pill buttons) shown when >1 students. "Open Student View" and all internal links include `?student=<id>`.
- `src/app/play/page.tsx` — same pattern. Student switcher shown below greeting when >1 students. "Start Today's Worksheet", "Parent view" all student-scoped.
- `src/app/worksheet/page.tsx` — same pattern. "← Play" link and fallback "Back to Play" are student-scoped. Session insert uses the resolved student.
- `src/app/worksheet/results/[sessionId]/page.tsx` — fixed ownership check: fetches session first, then verifies `session.student_id` belongs to current user's students (vs old approach of checking `students[0]` only). "← Play", "Try Again", "Back to Play" all use `session.student_id` for correct routing.

**Phase 2 — Onboarding / adding students**
- `src/app/onboarding/page.tsx` — counts existing students; shows "Add another student" heading and "← Back to dashboard" link for returning parents. First-time users see original "Set up your student" heading with no back link.
- Dashboard shows "+ Add Student" button → `/onboarding`.

**Phase 3 — Actions**
- `src/app/actions/students.ts`:
  - `createStudent`: counts pre-existing students; if 0 → redirect `/play?student=<newId>` (first-time flow unchanged); if 1+ → redirect `/dashboard?student=<newId>` (parent sees new child immediately)
  - `updateStudentPlacement`: now redirects to `/dashboard?student=<studentId>` (was `/dashboard`)

No DB schema changes. No new dependencies.

| Results "Back to Play" → /play?student=<id> | PASS |
| Results "Try Again" → /worksheet?student=<id> | PASS |
| Results "← Play" header → /play?student=<id> | PASS |
| Bob's session updated Bob's streak/points; Alice's stats unchanged | PASS |
| /dashboard with no param: defaults to first student (Alice) | PASS |
| Logout → login → /play (no param): defaults to first student | PASS |
| TypeScript: build clean, no type errors | PASS |

### Milestone 22 — Parent Dashboard Cleanup + History + Celebration (2026-04-17)

**Phase 1 — Parent dashboard cleanup**
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` — removed "Start Today's Worksheet" CTA from parent dashboard
- "Open Student View" is now the sole full-width action button
- Page heading changed to "{student.name}'s Overview" to reinforce oversight framing

**Phase 2 — Completed worksheet history**
- Added `recentSessions` query (last 10 completed sessions) to dashboard
- Added `id` field to `allLevels` fetch; built a `Map<level_id, levelInfo>` to look up topic/level for each session row
- "Recent Worksheets" section lists each session: date, level/topic, score, accuracy, time, pass/fail badge
- Each row links to `/worksheet/results/[sessionId]` — verified navigation works

**Phase 3 — Admin controls**
- `SetLevelForm` wrapped in a `<details>` element ("Admin controls") — collapsed by default
- Full placement functionality preserved inside the collapsed section
- `SetLevelForm.tsx` — updated `Level` type to accept optional `id` field

**Phase 4 — Celebration confetti**
- `src/app/worksheet/results/[sessionId]/CelebrationEffect.tsx` — new client component
  - Generates 70 confetti pieces client-side via `useEffect` (avoids SSR hydration mismatch)
  - Inline `<style>` keyframe `confettiFall` (no globals.css changes needed)
  - Pieces: random position, size (5–14px), color (7 brand/accent colors), delay (0–1.8s), duration (2.2–3.8s)
  - Auto-cleans up after 5.5s; `pointer-events-none` + `aria-hidden` so it doesn't block interaction or accessibility
- `src/app/worksheet/results/[sessionId]/page.tsx` — mounts `<CelebrationEffect />` when `accuracy === 100 || didAdvance`
- Confirmed: triggers on 100% score, triggers on level-up, does NOT trigger on partial/failing score

No DB schema changes. No new third-party dependencies.

### Milestone 21 — Level 11/1 Inequalities (2026-04-17)
- `src/lib/math/generators/inequalities.ts` — new generator for Level 11/1
  - 4 problem subtypes: x+a>b (x>n), x-a<b (x<n), ax≤b (x<=n), x/a≥b (x>=n)
  - Fixed deterministic pools (8 per subtype); equal 25% distribution per type
  - Answers use ASCII operators (>, <, <=, >=) for easy keyboard entry; prompts show Unicode (≤ ≥)
- `src/lib/math/generators/index.ts` — added route `11/1 → generateInequalities`; exported `InequalityProblem`, `InequalityProblemType`; added to `AnyProblemType` union
- `src/lib/lessons/index.ts` — added `11/1` lesson: "One-Variable Inequalities", worked example (2x≤10 → x<=5), tip
- `src/app/worksheet/WorksheetForm.tsx` — added `inequality` case to `problemTypeLabel()`; added `inputModeForType()` helper — inequality inputs use `inputMode="text"` (not numeric) for operator keys
- `src/app/actions/worksheet.ts` — added `normalizeInequality()` and inequality branch in `gradeAnswer()`:
  - Detects correctAnswer containing `<` or `>` → uses inequality grading path
  - Normalizes: lowercase, `≤`→`<=`, `≥`→`>=`, strip all whitespace
  - Accepts: `x>4`, `X > 6`, `x  >  7`, `x≤4`, `x≥12`, `X>=10` — all grade correctly
  - Does not affect existing arithmetic/factorization/equation grading

### Milestone 20 — Level 10/2 Variables on Both Sides (2026-04-17)
- `src/lib/math/generators/linear-equations.ts` — added `generateVariablesBothSides(count)` for Level 10/2
  - Pool of 10 equations with variables on both sides (e.g. `2x + 3 = x + 8`, answers 3–8)
  - All answers positive integers; cycles pool for any count; reuses `linear_equation` type — no grading changes
- `src/lib/math/generators/index.ts` — added route `10/2 → generateVariablesBothSides`
- `src/lib/lessons/index.ts` — added `10/2` lesson: "Variables on Both Sides", worked example (3x-4=x+10 → x=7), tip
- No DB schema changes, no new dependencies

### Milestone 19 — Level 10/1 Linear Equations (2026-04-17)
- `src/lib/math/generators/linear-equations.ts` — new generator for Level 10/1
  - 5 problem subtypes: addition (x+a=b), subtraction (x-a=b), multiplication (ax=b), division (x/a=b), two-step (ax±b=c, x/a±b=c)
  - Fixed deterministic pools; integer-only answers; count-driven distribution (25/25/20/15/remainder%)
  - All answers are single integers — compatible with existing exact-match grading, no grading changes needed
- `src/lib/math/generators/index.ts` — added route `10/1 → generateLinearEquations`; exported `LinearEquationProblem` and `LinearEquationType`; added `LinearEquationType` to `AnyProblemType` union
- `src/lib/lessons/index.ts` — added `10/1` lesson: "Linear Equations", two-step worked example (2x+5=13→x=4), check step, tip
- `src/app/worksheet/WorksheetForm.tsx` — added `linear_equation` case to `problemTypeLabel()`
- No DB schema changes, no new dependencies, no grading logic changes

### Milestone 18 — Student-First Daily Flow (2026-04-17)
- `src/app/actions/auth.ts` — `signIn` and `signUp` now redirect to `/play` instead of `/dashboard`
- `src/app/actions/students.ts` — `createStudent` now redirects to `/play` instead of `/dashboard` after onboarding
- `src/app/worksheet/results/[sessionId]/page.tsx`:
  - Primary return CTA changed from "Back to Dashboard" → "Back to Play" (`/play`)
  - Header nav link changed from "← Dashboard" → "← Play" (`/play`)
- `/play` already redirects to `/onboarding` if no student — new signup flow works without changes to the page
- `/dashboard` remains fully accessible via "Parent view" link on `/play`
- No DB changes, no new dependencies

### Milestone 17 — Parent/Student Dashboard Split (2026-04-16)
- `src/lib/format.ts` — extracted `formatSpeed()` helper shared by dashboard and play pages
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` — added "Open Student View" button (links to `/play`) alongside existing "Start Today's Worksheet" CTA; both in a responsive flex row; imported shared `formatSpeed`
- `src/app/play/page.tsx` — new student-facing server page at `/play`
  - Auth-protected (same pattern as dashboard)
  - Shows: student name greeting, streak 🔥, points, level, sublevel, mastery progress bar + text, current topic/description, speed target/accuracy/problems, last session summary
  - Does NOT show: parent email, placement control (SetLevelForm), admin wording
  - "Start Today's Worksheet" links to `/worksheet` (unchanged flow)
  - Subtle "Parent view" link in header returns to `/dashboard`
- No DB changes, no new dependencies, no changes to worksheet/progression logic

### Milestone 16 — Level 9/2 Factorization Continuation (2026-04-16)
- `src/lib/math/generators/factorization.ts` — extended `ProblemType` with `factor_pairs` and `common_factors`; added helpers `factorPairs()` and `commonFactors()`; added `generateFactorizationPairProblems(count)` for Level 9/2 with distribution 4 FP : 3 CF : 3 GCF
  - Factor pair pools: 10 non-square numbers (12–50); common factor pairs: 5 pairs; GCF pairs: 5 distinct from 9/1
  - Factor pairs answer format: `"1×12, 2×6, 3×4"` (sorted by first factor)
  - Common factors format: `"1, 2, 3, 6"` (sorted ascending)
  - GCF format: `"6"` (single integer — reuses existing exact-match grading)
- `src/lib/math/generators/index.ts` — added route `9/2 → generateFactorizationPairProblems`
- `src/lib/lessons/index.ts` — added `9/2` lesson: title "Factor Pairs and Common Factors", explanation, worked example (factor pairs of 12 + GCF of 12 and 18), and tip
- `src/app/worksheet/WorksheetForm.tsx` — added `factor_pairs` and `common_factors` cases to `problemTypeLabel()`
- No DB changes, no new dependencies, no grading logic changes

### Milestone 15 — Parent Placement Control (2026-04-16)
- `src/app/actions/students.ts` — added `updateStudentPlacement` server action
  - Verifies authenticated parent owns the student (RLS + explicit `parent_id` check)
  - Verifies target level exists in `levels` table before updating
  - Updates `students.current_level` and `students.current_sublevel`
  - Resets `student_level_progress.consecutive_passes` to 0 for the new level (if a row exists), preventing stale mastery carry-over
  - Redirects to `/dashboard` on success; returns `{ error }` on failure
- `src/app/dashboard/SetLevelForm.tsx` — new client component
  - Combined `<select>` listing all curriculum levels as "Level X.Y — Topic: Description"
  - Defaults to current placement; `useActionState` for inline error display
  - Styled consistently with brand system
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` — fetches all levels, renders `SetLevelForm` below Current Focus card
  - Shows current placement ("Currently on Level X.Y") inline in the form
  - Stats row (Level / Sublevel cards) continues to reflect live placement
  - TypeScript: no type errors

### Milestone 14 — Worksheet Scratchpad (2026-04-16)
- `src/app/worksheet/WorksheetScratchpad.tsx` — client component with HTML5 canvas drawing area
  - Pointer events (mouse, touch, stylus) via `onPointerDown/Move/Up/Cancel`
  - `setPointerCapture` ensures strokes aren't interrupted when pointer leaves canvas
  - `touch-none` CSS class (`touch-action: none`) prevents page scroll while drawing
  - Stylus pressure support: line width scales with `e.pressure` for pen input
  - Clear button wipes canvas via `clearRect`
  - Canvas auto-resizes to container width on mount and window resize, restoring drawing content
  - 320px fixed height — large enough for tablet use
- `src/app/worksheet/page.tsx` — imports and renders `<WorksheetScratchpad />` below `<WorksheetForm>`
- No DB changes, no third-party libraries, no changes to grading/session/progression logic

### Milestone 13 — Lesson Cards / Learn System (2026-04-16)
- `src/lib/lessons/index.ts` — static lesson content for all 7 supported levels (1/1, 1/2, 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 9/1). Each entry has: `title`, `explanation`, `example` (problem, steps[], answer), `tip`. Exported `getLesson(level, sublevel)` returns `Lesson | null`.
- `src/app/worksheet/LessonCard.tsx` — collapsible `<details>` card (open by default, zero JS). Shows title, explanation, worked example with numbered steps, answer badge, and tip in amber box. Visually consistent with brand system.
- `src/app/worksheet/page.tsx` — calls `getLesson()` and renders `<LessonCard>` above `<WorksheetForm>` when content exists. Gracefully skipped if `null`.
- No DB changes, no new dependencies, no logic changes to grading/session/progression.

---

### Milestone 12 — PWA Setup (2026-04-15)
- `public/icon-192.png` — generated from `math-step-logo.png` via sharp, 192×192
- `public/icon-512.png` — generated from `math-step-logo.png` via sharp, 512×512
- `public/manifest.webmanifest` — name, short_name, description, start_url, display: standalone, theme_color: #2d6a35, background_color: #f7faf7, both icons with `any maskable` purpose
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — added `manifest`, `themeColor`, `appleWebApp`, and `icons.apple` to Next.js `Metadata` export
- Manifest served at 200, icons serve at 200, HTML contains `<link rel="manifest">`, `<link rel="apple-touch-icon">`, and `mobile-web-app-capable` meta tags
- TypeScript: no type errors
- No service worker / offline caching added (not needed for basic installability)

---

### Milestone 11 — Visual Design Refresh (2026-04-15)
- `public/math-step-logo.png` — logo copied to public folder for Next.js Image serving
- `src/app/globals.css` — brand token palette added (`--brand-50` through `--brand-900`, `--background`, `--surface`)
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — metadata title/description updated to MathStep brand copy
- All pages refreshed with cohesive `#BAE0BD` brand system:
  - `src/app/page.tsx` — home: logo, green CTA, soft tagline
  - `src/app/login/page.tsx` — card layout, logo, brand inputs/button
  - `src/app/signup/page.tsx` — same pattern as login
  - `src/app/onboarding/page.tsx` + `OnboardingForm.tsx` — logo, card, brand inputs
  - `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` — logo header, stat cards with brand borders, CTA button, last session/current focus cards
  - `src/app/worksheet/page.tsx` — branded header, logo, fallback states updated
  - `src/app/worksheet/WorksheetForm.tsx` — brand timer, green number badges, larger inputs (`inputMode="numeric"`)
  - `src/app/worksheet/results/[sessionId]/page.tsx` — pass/fail score card, mastery progress, problem review, two-button footer
- TypeScript: no type errors

---

### Milestone 10 — Multiplication Generators (2026-04-15)
- `src/lib/math/generators/multiplication.ts` — two generators:
  - `generateBasicMultiplication(count)` — 10 fixed pairs, single-digit × single-digit facts (e.g. 2×3, 4×5, 9×3), for Level 3/1
  - `generateMultiDigitMultiplication(count)` — 10 fixed pairs, two-digit × one-digit (e.g. 12×3, 14×2, 16×5), for Level 3/2
- `src/lib/math/generators/index.ts` — router extended: 3/1 → basic multiplication, 3/2 → multi-digit multiplication; exports `MultiplicationProblem`, `MultiplicationProblemType`, updated `AnyProblemType` union
- `WorksheetForm.tsx` — `multiplication` case added to `problemTypeLabel()` switch
- Grading: no changes needed — existing single-integer exact match handles multiplication answers correctly

### Milestone 9 — Subtraction Generators (2026-04-15)
- `src/lib/math/generators/subtraction.ts` — two generators:
  - `generateSingleDigitSubtraction(count)` — 10 fixed pairs, results 0–9, no negatives, for Level 2/1
  - `generateDoubleDigitSubtraction(count)` — 10 fixed pairs, age-appropriate double-digit, manageable borrowing, for Level 2/2
- `src/lib/math/generators/index.ts` — router extended: 2/1 → single-digit subtraction, 2/2 → double-digit subtraction; exports `SubtractionProblem`, `SubtractionProblemType`, and updated `AnyProblemType` union
- `WorksheetForm.tsx` — `subtraction` case added to `problemTypeLabel()` switch
- Grading: no changes needed — existing single-integer exact match handles subtraction answers correctly

### Milestone 8 — Variable Problem Count from Curriculum Metadata (2026-04-15)
- `generateProblems(levelNumber, sublevelNumber, count)` — added required `count` param to the router
- `generateSingleDigitAddition(count)` — cycles the 10-pair pool to fill any requested count
- `generateDoubleDigitAddition(count)` — same pattern for 10 double-digit pairs
- `generateFactorizationProblems(count)` — distributes count across 4 subtypes at 3:2:3:2 ratio, cycles each pool, remainder assigned to LCM so total always equals count exactly
- `worksheet/page.tsx` — reads `level.problems_per_session` and passes it as count to `generateProblems()`. DB insert, grading, results all use `problems.length` — no hardcoded 10 anywhere

### Milestone 7 — Addition Generators + Grading Fix (2026-04-15)
- `src/lib/math/generators/addition.ts` — two generators:
  - `generateSingleDigitAddition()` — 10 fixed pairs, sums within 10, for Level 1/1
  - `generateDoubleDigitAddition()` — 10 fixed pairs, double-digit operands with mild carrying, for Level 1/2
- `src/lib/math/generators/index.ts` — generator router updated: routes 1/1 → single-digit, 1/2 → double-digit, 9/1 → factorization, all others → `[]` (Coming Soon)
- `WorksheetForm.tsx` — type updated from `MathProblem['type']` to `AnyProblemType` union; `addition` case added to `problemTypeLabel()`
- Grading fix in `worksheet.ts`: replaced digit-sort normalization for single-number answers with exact integer comparison — prevents `"36"` matching `"63"` for addition/GCF/LCM answers; multi-token answers (prime factorization, list factors) still use order-insensitive sort

### Milestone 6 — Level Progression (2026-04-15)
- Worksheet routing now uses student's actual `current_level` / `current_sublevel` — no more hardcoded 9/1
- Unsupported levels (no generator) show a "Coming Soon" message without creating a session
- `student_level_progress` upserted on every submission: `consecutive_passes` increments on pass, resets to 0 on fail
- Level advancement: when `consecutive_passes >= consecutive_passes_required`, student advances to next level (ordered by `level_number asc, sublevel_number asc`); old level progress reset to 0 after advance
- If no next level exists, student stays at current level (no crash)
- Results page shows advancement banner ("Level Up! Advanced to Level X.Y — Topic") or mastery progress ("N / M passes, X more to advance")
- Dashboard "Mastery progress" stat replaced "Passes required" — shows `consecutive_passes / consecutive_passes_required` live
- Dev-mode warning banner removed (was only relevant when level was hardcoded)

### Milestone 5 — Session Flow (2026-04-15)
- Pass/fail now uses both accuracy threshold AND speed target (`accuracy >= threshold && timeTaken <= speedTarget`)
- Streak updates on session submit: `current_streak`, `longest_streak`, `total_sessions`, `total_points`, `last_session_date`
  - Streak increments if last session was yesterday, resets if gap > 1 day, unchanged if same day
  - Points: +10 for completion, +15 (i.e. +5 pass bonus) if passed
- Ownership check on results page: verifies `session.student_id` belongs to the authenticated parent's student
- Last session summary card on dashboard (score, accuracy, time, pass/fail badge)
- Fixed dashboard streak/points query: switched from PostgREST embedded join (`streaks(...)` on students) to direct `streaks` select — the join was returning stale cached values

### Milestone 4 — Worksheet Engine Foundation
- `src/lib/math/generators/factorization.ts` — pure algorithmic generator for level 9/1 (Factorization)
  - 10 problems per session: 3 prime factorization, 2 list factors, 3 GCF, 2 LCM
  - Deterministic fixed pools; no randomness; canonical answer formats
  - Helpers: `primeFactors()`, `allFactors()`, `gcd()`, `lcm()`
- `src/lib/math/generators/index.ts` — level router (`generateProblems(levelNumber, sublevelNumber)`)
- `src/app/worksheet/page.tsx` — protected server page
  - Auth guard + student fetch + level metadata fetch
  - Dev mode notice when student is not on 9/1
  - Timer placeholder (00:00)
  - 10 numbered problems with answer input fields
  - Disabled submit button placeholder
- Dashboard updated: "Start Today's Worksheet" button links to `/worksheet`

### Milestone 3 — Curriculum / Levels Data Layer
- Dashboard fetches matching `levels` row by `(level_number, sublevel_number)`
- "Current Focus" card renders: topic, description, speed target (formatted), accuracy %, problems/session, passes required
- Safe fallback if no level record found — no crash
- `formatSpeed()` helper converts seconds to human-readable string

### Milestone 2 — Student Onboarding
- `src/app/onboarding/page.tsx` — protected server page
- `src/app/onboarding/OnboardingForm.tsx` — client form with `useActionState`
- `src/app/actions/students.ts` — `createStudent` server action: inserts student + streak row
- Dashboard redirects to `/onboarding` if no students found
- Dashboard updated to show student name, level, sublevel, streak, total points

### Milestone 1 — Auth + Base Setup
- Supabase installed and configured (`@supabase/ssr`, `@supabase/supabase-js`)

## Important Fixes Made

- **Dashboard streaks query** — switched from `students.select('*, streaks(...)')` PostgREST embedding to a direct `streaks.select(...).eq('student_id', student.id)`. The embedded join was returning stale data (appeared to return the default 0 values rather than updated values). Direct query works correctly.
- **`server.ts` setAll try/catch** — wrapped cookie `setAll` in try/catch. Without it, Server Components calling `getUser()` when a token refresh triggers a `setAll` would throw. Middleware handles the actual refresh; the try/catch silences the expected error in Server Component context.
- **`total_points` column location** — original plan put `total_points` on `students`. Real schema has it on `streaks`. Corrected after introspecting the live database.
- **`streaks` insert** — original plan passed `current_streak: 0` explicitly. Real schema defaults it; passing it caused no error but was unnecessary. Removed.
- **`students` insert** — removed `total_points: 0` from insert payload after confirming column doesn't exist on that table.

## Immediate Next Tasks

1. Deployment prep — Vercel or similar
2. Add generators for remaining curriculum levels (4/1, 4/2, etc.) as needed
